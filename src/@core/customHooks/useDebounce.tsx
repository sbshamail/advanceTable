//difference useDebounceCallback vs debounce
// useDebounceCallback is React-specific and relies on React hooks (useState, useCallback), making it suited for use within React components where the debounced function needs to be tied to the component’s render cycle.
// debounce is a general-purpose debouncing function that can be used in any JavaScript code, not tied to React, and uses simple variable scoping rather than React’s state.

// detail
// Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed. It ensures that the function is only called after a certain amount of time has passed since the last invocation. This is useful for cases where a function is triggered multiple times in quick succession, like handling user input in a search bar.

// For example, if a user types in a search field, instead of making a request every time a key is pressed, debouncing ensures that the request is made only after the user stops typing for a specified period (e.g., 300ms). This improves performance and reduces unnecessary operations.

// In short, debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a certain "quiet" period of no activity.
